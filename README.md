This project is made for a course at the University of Basel. We coded a game called Key H(a)unt.
The game is a top down labyrinth in a dungeon. The map layout is grid-based. The ideal amount of players would be 4. There are 4 hunters and one ghost. The hunters goal is to escape the haunted house. The ghost wants to catch the hunters.
The players only see their room. 
The game is round based. Each round is 15 seconds long. In those 15 seconds, every player can enter one action. The player can either, enter the next room, open a chest or do nothing. If the timer runs out and the player did not make a move, the game assumes that the player wanted to wait. The chests are random and contain at least 1 key. Any one of the explorers can open the escape door at the center of the dungeon. If the door has been opened, the players can escape. 
The ghost can not open any chest. The ghost can go through walls, which means they do not have to have a door to go to the any adjacent room in any direction.
